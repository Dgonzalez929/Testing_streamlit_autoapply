                "Took the initiative to research and calculate recommendation system metrics using a partition matrix, and developed an alternative data processing approach that reduced processing time and cut costs by up to 50%. Driven by curiosity and a focus on innovation, I researched and implemented new technologies, including the Jax library, to leverage GPU computational power, achieving a 95% reduction in processing time.",
                "Optimized algorithms for a forecasting model by leveraging Python, Numpy, and Polars libraries, resulting in a 98.47% improvement in processing time and an 85% reduction in peak memory usage for efficient implementation."
