                "Programming and deployed machine learning, deep learning, and statistical models in Python to generate actionable business insights, including a Recommendation System that increased client sales by 21%.",
                "Designed and deployed econometric models with exogenous data, applying data analytics to uncover additional insights beyond the client's data, creating new business opportunities. These insights increased information consumption by 15%.",
                "Took the initiative to research and calculate recommendation system metrics using a partition matrix, and developed an alternative data processing approach that reduced processing time and cut costs by up to 50%. Driven by curiosity and a focus on innovation, I researched and implemented new technologies, including the Jax library, to leverage GPU computational power, achieving a 95% reduction in processing time.",
                "Optimized algorithms for a forecasting model by leveraging Python, Numpy, and Polars libraries, resulting in a 98.47% improvement in processing time and an 85% reduction in peak memory usage for efficient implementation."
